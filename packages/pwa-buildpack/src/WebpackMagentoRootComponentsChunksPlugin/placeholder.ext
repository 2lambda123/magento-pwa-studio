This placeholder is necessary for our `pages-chunk-loader`. We want
to force webpack to bundle chunks for each component in a `pages` directory, without
having to write a temp file to disk with all the dynamic `import(path)` expressions.

Instead, `MagentoPageChunksPlugin` injects a new entry point, that uses
the `pages-chunk-loader` plugin. You cannot point a loader to a file that
does not exist, so we use this dummy file to get past the webpack restriction.

The dummy extension `ext` (as opposed to `js`) is used to prevent this file from getting run through any
loaders the user has configured
