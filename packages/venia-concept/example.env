########## example.env ########################################################
#
#   This file is an example of how to configure Magento PWA Studio at
#   development time and runtime. Use these environment variables for any
#   settings which will change between your production, development, and
#   testing environments.
#
#   Copy this file to a file in the `venia-concept` directory called `.env`
#   to activate your project. If a `.env` file is missing, or required
#   variables are missing in your `.env` file, you should be notified.

########## Connecting to a Magento store ######################################
#
#   Connect to an instance of Magento 2.3 by specifying its public
#   domain name. **REQUIRED.** Example:
#   MAGENTO_BACKEND_DOMAIN="https://magento2.local"
#
#   Use a particular website code when making API calls. Defaults to 'base',
#   but for your PWA to act as a different "website" in the Magento admin,
#   you can change this variable. Example:
#   MAGENTO_WEBSITE_CODE="foo"
#
#   TODO: This env var can override the hardcoded product media path, which we
#   need to hardcode due to https://github.com/magento/graphql-ce/issues/88
#   REQUIRED, and automatically set here:
MAGENTO_BACKEND_PRODUCT_MEDIA_PATH="/media/catalog/product"
#   DO NOT CHANGE THIS VALUE unless you have a custom static setup.
#
#   These legacy environment variables from 1.x are no longer necessary:
#   - `MAGENTO_BACKEND_PUBLIC_PATH`: Since PWA Studio no longer makes _themes_,
#     it is no longer necessary to follow theme directory structure.
#   - `SERVICE_WORKER_FILE_NAME`: The `sw.js` filename is suitable for almost
#     all cases, and it does not vary by environment, so it should not be
#     an environment variable. It has been hardcoded into package.json config.

########## UPWARD server production configuration #############################
#
#   The current PWA Studio production server is built with NodeJS; it is an
#   implementation of the UPWARD spec, and is theoretically swappable with
#   any other UPWARD-compliant server, with minimal configuration or code
#   changes. Since `upward-js` is the current default implementation, the
#   following environment variables configure `upward-js` specifically.
#
#   Give the server the location of the UPWARD YAML configuration file which
#   specifies its behavior. **REQUIRED**. For Venia, this is automatically set:
UPWARD_JS_UPWARD_PATH=venia-upward.yml
#
#   Tell the upward-js server to bind to a local address and port on launch.
#   Default 1 (true). **REQUIRED** unless you have a custom production setup.
UPWARD_JS_BIND_LOCAL=1
#
#   Tell the upward-js prod server to log the bound URL to stdout. Useful in
#   testing and discovery scenarios, but may be disabled in production.
UPWARD_JS_LOG_URL=1
#
#   Specify a port the upward-js prod-server will bind to. If unspecified, an
#   open port will be found.
#   UPWARD_JS_PORT=8008

########## webpack-dev-server development configuration  ######################

#   Set variables for webpack-dev-server for editing and debugging scenarios.
#
#   Set this to 1 (true) to force ServiceWorkers in development.
