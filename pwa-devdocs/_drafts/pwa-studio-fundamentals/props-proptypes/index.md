title: Props & Prop-Types
---

## Overview

In this tutorial we will demonstrate how we can use component props can be used and type checked.

## Create a child component

First create a child component which we will use in the component later.

_/src/components/Foo/greeting.js_

```javascript
import React from 'react';

const Greeting = props => {
  const { name } = props;

  return (
    <strong>Hello, {name}!</strong>
  );
}

export default Greeting;
```

Import the Greeting component to the Foo component:  

```javascript
import Greeting from './greeting';
```

Render the Greeting component in the Foo component, passing in your name as a property.    
_remember you need to wrap multiple JSX elements in a react fragment or a wrapper div_ 

```jsx
<Greeting name="Joe Bloggs" />
```

## Type Checking with Prop Types

> As your app grows, you can catch a lot of bugs with typechecking. For some applications, you can use JavaScript extensions like Flow or TypeScript to typecheck your whole application. But even if you donâ€™t use those, React has some built-in typechecking abilities.

PWA Studio uses prop types in the following way. Import the propTypes library to the Greeting component:   

```javascript
import { PropTypes } from 'prop-types';
```

Add type checking by assigning the special propTypes property to the Greeting component just before the `export` statment.

```javascript
// other code...

Greeting.propTypes = {
  name: PropTypes.string
};

export default Greeting;
```

Try passing in an invalid prop type to the Greeting component. And check your browser console for any errors.    
i.e. `<Greeting name={2} />`
