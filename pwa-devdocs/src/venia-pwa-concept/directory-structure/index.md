title: Venia directory structure
---

This topic is an overview of the directory structure for the Venia theme project.
It provides information about the different directories and files in the project.

## The root directory

The majority of files and directories in the Venia root directory are boilerplate directories and files for a standard Magento theme.

### Notable Magento theme files

`theme.xml`

: This file contains the basic theme meta-information, such as the name and parent, for the Venia theme.

`registration.php`

: This file registers Venia as a Magento theme.

`Magento_Theme/templates/root.phtml`

: This file is a template override for the default `root.phtml` file.
  In a standard Magento theme, the `root.phtml` file is the base template on which every page is built upon.

  In Venia, this file provides the bare, skeleton HTML that the PWA theme populates on page load.

`etc/view.xml`

: This file exists to make Venia compatible with the Magento 2 theme system.
  The content is mostly a copy of the original file from the Magento source.

For more information on basic theme structure, see: [Magento theme structure][]

## The `src` directory

The `src` directory contains all the PWA code for the Venia theme.

### `src/RootComponents`

This directory contains directories for all Venia root components.
Root components provide the main React component entry point for the different page types.

Examples of page types include:

* CMS
* Category
* Product

When a page is requested, the [Peregrine router][] determines which root component to use based on the URL path.

### `src/actions`

The `src/actions` directory contains all [Redux][] action creator definitions.
The files in this directory group the action creators together based on the application feature they affect.

action creator
: As its name suggests, an action creator is a function that returns an **action** object.

action
: An action object is a JavaScript object that contains information about the activity being performed. 
  It is used by [reducers][] to update the application state through the [Store][].

For more information on actions, see the [official documentation for Redux actions][].

### `src/components`

The `src/components` directory contains the project-specific components used in the Venia theme.

Components in the Venia theme are React components.
They define the structure and render the visual elements of the different pieces on a page.

React components are generally written to be small and re-usable, so
you will find multiple component definition files in a single feature directory.

{: .bs-callout .bs-callout-info}
**Note:**
Not all components used in the Venia them are in this directory.
Some components are imported from the [Peregrine][] project or other sources.

For more information on components, see the [official documentation for React components][].

#### CSS modules

CSS modules are style definitions that are scoped to a specific component.
This allows for component-specific style definitions without side effects on other pieces of the page.

These CSS files are in the same directory and have the same base name as the components that uses them.
For example, the styles defined in `Footer/footer.css` are applied only to the component defined in `Footer/footer.js`.

### `src/reducers`

The `src/reducers` directory contains [Redux][] reducer definitions.
A reducer updates the application state given the current state and an [action][] object.

Each file in this directory contains a reducer that manages a specific part of the application state.  

Reducers are written as pure functions.
This means that when it is given the same set of arguments, it will return the same results.

For more information on reducers, see the [official documentation for Redux reducers][].

### `src/shared`

The `src/shared` directory contains placeholder data used in the application.
They are used to simulate API calls or as temporary data for proofs of concepts during the development phase of this project.

### `src/util`

The `src/util` directory contain useful JavaScript utility functions used throughout the project.
